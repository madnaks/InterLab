# InterLab

InterLab is a project which the main goal is to practice the technologies and things I learn or know.

The repository contains the **client** and **server** side divided with different technologies

* Client side
  * It's an SPA Application using Angular 15 as a Framework

* Server side:
  * It's an ASP .NET Core Web API using .NET 6.
  * <a href="https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/clean-architecture-in-asp-net-core-web-api/" target="_blank">Clean Architecture</a> is used to helps us to keep an entire application code under control.
